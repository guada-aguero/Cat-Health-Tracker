## Project Description: Cat Health and Activity Tracker

### Origin of the Project
This project originated from a desire to assist cat owners in monitoring and improving their cats' health and activity levels. As a pet owner, it can be challenging to keep track of all aspects of a cat's wellness, including diet, grooming, and medical history. This application aims to provide a comprehensive tool to address these challenges.

### Main Objective
The main objective of the Cat Health and Activity Tracker is to create an interactive web-based application that helps cat owners track their cats' health metrics, activity levels, and routines. The tool provides insights into cat wellness, suggests activities and diets, schedules vaccinations and treatments, tracks grooming and dental care, and helps optimize cat energy levels and sleep routines.

### Research Questions
1. What factors contribute to cat health and wellness?
2. How can cat owners improve their cats' activity levels and diets?
3. How do different feeding schedules (routine feeding vs. food always available) impact cat health?
4. What trends can be identified in cat health and activity over time?
5. How do grooming habits and routine care affect the overall wellness of cats?
6. How can feeding routines and activity levels be optimized to improve cats' energy levels and sleep patterns?

### Hypotheses
1. **Activity Impact Hypothesis**: Increased activity levels lead to improved cat health and wellness.
2. **Diet Improvement Hypothesis**: Optimized diets contribute to better health metrics in cats.
3. **Health Tracking Hypothesis**: Regular tracking of health metrics helps in early detection and prevention of health issues.
4. **Routine Care Hypothesis**: Regular vaccinations, anti-parasitic treatments, grooming, and dental care contribute to overall cat wellness.
5. **Sleep Optimization Hypothesis**: Proper feeding routines and activity levels help regulate cat energy levels and improve sleep patterns, aligning better with the owner's sleep schedule.

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to provide cat owners with a user-friendly tool to monitor and enhance their cats' health and wellness. By integrating data tracking and analysis, the application offers valuable insights and recommendations to help cat owners make informed decisions about their pets' care.

### Methodology
#### Data Collection
- **Sources**: User-contributed data via online surveys and forms.
- **Example Data Points**:
  - Daily Activity Levels (types, duration)
  - Diet and Nutrition Information (types of food, portion sizes, feeding schedule)
  - Health Metrics (weight, vet visit details, vaccination and medication records)
  - Routine Care (vaccination schedules, anti-parasitic treatment schedules, grooming schedules)
  - Sleep Patterns (sleep duration, sleep quality)
  - Awareness Questions (teeth cleaning, shedding management, playtime importance)

#### Data Cleaning
- Standardize data formats (e.g., date fields, units for weight and portion sizes).
- Handle missing values appropriately.
- Verify data accuracy.
- Convert categorical variables into numerical codes for analysis.

#### Data Analysis
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Summarize data using descriptive statistics and visualize data distributions.
- **Comparative Analysis**: Compare health metrics between groups.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Analyze correlations between variables.
- **Hypothesis Testing**: Perform statistical tests to determine significant differences between groups.
- **Tools Used**: pandas, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, seaborn.

### Visualizations
- **Interactive Tableau Dashboards**: Design interactive dashboards to visualize key metrics (activity levels, diet, health metrics, sleep duration, and quality).

### Final Product
The final product is an interactive web application:
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js for the user interface.
- **Backend**: Django for handling data submission and API integration.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for storing collected data.
- **Features**:
  - Data Input: Forms for users to input data about their cats' health, activity, diet, and routines.
  - Recommendations: Provide personalized recommendations based on collected data.
  - Visualizations: Interactive charts and graphs to track cat wellness metrics.
  - Alerts and Reminders: Notify users of upcoming vaccinations, treatments, and grooming schedules (to be added in future enhancements).

### Challenges and Future Enhancements
- **Challenges**:
  - Finding Appropriate APIs: Difficulty in locating APIs that provide comprehensive and reliable cat health and wellness data.
  - Data Integration: Challenges in merging data from different sources, including manually scraped data, to maintain consistency and reliability across the dataset.
- **Future Enhancements**:
  - Overcoming the challenges mentioned above by finding suitable APIs and improving data integration methods.
  - Adding features such as alerts and reminders for upcoming cat care tasks.
